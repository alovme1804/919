          <textarea id="message" name="message_to_recipient" readonly placeholder="I want to express my deepest gratitude for the time you have spent with me. I truly appreciate every moment we shared together. You are an extraordinary person with a charming presence and a melodious voice. You deserve nothing but the best in life.

Actually, I wanted to convey this in a proper way, but you didn’t give me a choice. I don’t know why you did this without giving an explanation. If I made any mistakes, I am truly sorry. I want to hear it from you I want to improve myself and become a better person. I knew this would happen and that I should always be ready for this day. From the moment you contacted me again, I told myself not to expect anything from you.

I just wanted to love you until the time came when I had to forget you, because we have strong faith in our religions and both of us want to have a partner of the same faith. Even so, you are the person I truly love right now. One of the hardest things for me is to get used to being without someone. Even though it’s hard, I respect your decision.

I always check my phone, trying to stay awake even though I’m sleepy, just to wait for your message. I know you’re busy I respect your time and don’t want to bother you. That’s why I don’t send you many messages when you’re not active/online on Instagram. I see some signs that you are intentionally ignoring me, but I have no right to demand anything because I am nobody to you. When I miss you, I always read our messages and listen to your voice messages, even though it makes me miss you more. I miss you from the time when we first met, when you still seemed excited to exchange messages with me.

Reflecting on our short time together, I realize how much I enjoyed and appreciated our conversations and the moments we shared. Your kindness, warmth, and positive energy have always been a mood booster and a comfort to me. You have a special way of making people feel valued, and I am grateful to have experienced that firsthand.

I sincerely hope you find happiness in everything you do and always take good care of yourself. I am very grateful for all the beautiful memories with you. Every moment we shared is a precious memory that I will always cherish. I love you deeply and sincerely.

I am grateful that God brought us together. In every meeting, there is always something to learn, and I have learned so much from you. Every moment with you is a valuable lesson that I will carry with me.

May you always be protected and blessed. I also hope all your dreams come true and that you are always in good health. Life is a journey full of ups and downs, but I believe you have the strength and resilience to overcome any challenges that come your way. Keep pursuing your dreams with the same passion and determination you have shown so far.

As we part ways, know that you will always have a special place in my heart. Whenever you need someone, I will be there for you. Although I know you have people who care about you, I just want to offer my support to you. I truly apologize if I have wronged you in any way I am genuinely sorry. I also apologize if I have been boring. Thank you once again for everything. I will cherish the memories we created and hold onto the lessons I’ve learned from you.

I hope we can meet again someday in real life, with better versions of ourselves. I pray every day for that time to come. Remember my name. Until then, take care and stay healthy. Goodbye. I hope your future is filled with happiness, success, and love.

Warm regards,"></textarea><br>
